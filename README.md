# React_Employee_Directory

## Description

This project uses React.js props to modularize code and update the virtual DOM. With this code, the user can go from a landing/splash page, to an about page, to the Mock Employee directory. The directory is updated with an API call to Randonuser.me. The user can then sort employees by a variable, in this case the user first name, and search by a first name and the virtual DOM will update its state on keystrokes.
